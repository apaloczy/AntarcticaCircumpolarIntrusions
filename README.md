# AntarcticaCircumpolarIntrusions
This repository contains codes and processed datasets for a manuscript entitled **"Oceanic heat delivery to the Antarctic continental shelf: Large-scale, low-frequency variability"**, by A. Palóczy, S. T. Gille and J. L. McClean (submitted to *Journal of Geophysical Research – Oceans*). [This Jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/apaloczy/AntarcticaCircumpolarIntrusions/blob/master/index.ipynb) provides an overview of the contents.

The directory **plot_figs/** contains the Python codes used to produce all figures in the main manuscript (Figures 1-10) and in the Supplemental Materials (Figures S1-S10). The codes depend on the data files in the **data_reproduce_figs/** directory. Some of these are too large to be included in this repository, but are available for download from the links listed on the accompanying README files. Please contact [André Palóczy](mailto:apaloczy@ucsd.edu) if you have issues downloading the files.

# Abstract
Onshore penetration of heat across the Antarctic continental slope (ACS) plays a major role in global sea level rise by contributing to the basal melting of Antarctic ice shelves. We investigate the time-mean ($\Phi^\text{mean}$) and eddy ($\Phi^\text{eddy}$) components of the total heat transport ($\Phi$) across the 1000 m isobath along the entire ACS using a 0.1\textdegree global coupled ocean/sea ice simulation based on the Los Alamos Parallel Ocean Program (POP) and sea ice (CICE) model. Comparison with \textit{in situ} hydrographic profiles shows that the model successfully represents the basic water mass structure, with a warm bias in the Circumpolar Deep Water layer. Distinct segments of on-shelf $\Phi$, with lengths of O(100-1000 km), are found along the entire ACS. The circumpolar integral of the annually-averaged $\Phi$ is O(20 TW), with $\Phi^\text{eddy}$ always directed onto the shelf, while $\Phi^\text{mean}$ fluctuates between on-shelf and off-shelf. Eddy stirring along isoneutral surfaces is often the dominant process by which eddies transport heat across the ACS, but advection of heat by both the eddies and the mean flow can also be significant depending on the along- and across-slope location. The seasonal and interannual variability of the circumpolarly-integrated $\Phi^\text{mean}$ is modulated by the convergence of Ekman transport within the ACS. Prominent warming features at the bottom of the continental shelf (consistent with observed temperature trends) are found both during high-SAM and high-Niño 3.4 periods, suggesting that climate modes can modulate the heat transfer from the Southern Ocean to the ACS across the entire Antarctic margin.
