# AntarcticCircumpolarIntrusions/data_reproduce_figs/cache

The files in this directory are not being tracked to save storage.
They are files generated during intermediate processing steps by some of the notebooks
in the AntarcticCircumpolarIntrusions/plot_figs directory, and will be created on demand if the user
clones the repository and runs the relevant notebooks.
